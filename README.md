# MajulaOSTRoundtable

Mirror for Nexus

Replaces the Roundtable Hold OST with the Majula OST from Dark Souls 2.

Installation:

-Download this specific ModEngine2: https://github.com/vswarte/ModEngine2/actions/runs/8931640677/artifacts/1468983823ï»¿ (it will only work with this one) and extract the .zip inside the .zip file to anywhere you like (preferably not in the Desktop/Download folder. On another driver or inside the game folder works just fine) - so that you end up with a folder named ModEngine-2.1.0.0-win64 with these files inside:
